Header Guards:
	The header guards are structured as follows
		
		_GUL_MODULE_FILENAME_H_
		
	and FILENAME is split accoring to camelcase. 
	
	Example:
		impl:   memory/SharedPtr.cpp
		header: include/SharedPtr.h
		Header Guard: _GUL_MEMORY_SHARED_PTR_H_

Includes:
	To include a a header we generally use "" only for 
	includes of the standard library or other external
	files we use <>
