Header Guards:
	The header guards are structured as follows
		
		_GUL_MODULE_FILENAME_H_
		
	and FILENAME is split according to camelcase. 
	
	Example:
		impl:   memory/SharedPtr.cpp
		header: include/SharedPtr.h
		Header Guard: _GUL_MEMORY_SHARED_PTR_H_
		
	In addition we use the #pragma once directive 
	before the header guards. Furthermore, the guarding
	is done before the license commentary.
	
	Example of SharedPtr.h:
		#pragma once
		#ifndef _GUL_MEMORY_SHARED_PTR_H_
		#define _GUL_MEMORY_SHARED_PTR_H_
		
		/********************************************************

		** This file is part of gul (Graphic Utility Library).
		**

				....
		
		#endif
		
		

Includes:
	To include a a header we generally use "" only for 
	includes of the standard library or other external
	files we use <>
